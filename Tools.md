# Tools I Use

- [Asana](http://asana.com/) for project management (business & personal)
- [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) for stay efficent
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to store any and all docs, the mobile version's document scanner is great for storing paper docs. I can eliminate most of my paper docs with this.

Of course for personal stuff:

- [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for personal & social bookmarking
- [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for storage
- [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org/) for storage
- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) for financial overview
