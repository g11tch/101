What follows is a [The Setup](http://usesthis.com)-style article of what I use to get things done.

### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Ojas. I write software for a living.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm still using a 13" Mid 2011 MacBook Air. It seems to keep on rocking and I haven't found the need to get something more powerful yet. I have an iPhone 5 I use a lot too.

### And what software?

I use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) for most of my text editing, although I prefer to use [Mou](http://mouapp.com) for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.

I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for package management, [Git](http://www.git-scm.com), [Github](https://github.com), and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) for source control. I use [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com) for general image editing.

I do most of my programming in [python](https://www.python.org) and should probably get more familiar with [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). I've heard MacVim with Janus is a good way to make the transition to Vim, which is something I would like to make time to learn.

More:

- [Asana](http://asana.com/) for project management (business & personal)
- [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) for stay efficent
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to store any and all docs, the mobile version's document scanner is great for storing paper docs. I can eliminate most of my paper docs with this.

Of course for personal stuff:

- [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for personal & social bookmarking
- [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for storage
- [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org/) for storage
- [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) for financial overview
